## Covid-19 Assessment Bot
The COVID-19 symptom checker bot is configured using **Microsoft Healtcare Bot** services. 
The bot answers the FAQ's related to COVID-19. [More Info](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/updated-on-5-24-2020-quick-start-setting-up-your-covid-19/ba-p/1230537).

The design and code is adjusted to redirect specific questions to appropriate answers. The bot is finally deployed to ***Azure*** and embedded in the weather app. 

Please ***note that the Azure app service plan costs a lot and the deployment had to be stopped due to a hefty cost.***
